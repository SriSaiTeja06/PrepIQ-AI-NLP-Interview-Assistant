## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

1.  **Python:** Version 3.9 or higher **AND** 3.11 or lower.
2.  **Git:** For cloning the repository.
3.  **Node.js and npm:** Required for the frontend application. Download from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/).
4.  **FFmpeg:** Required by the Whisper library for audio processing.
    *   **Windows:** Install using Chocolatey (`choco install ffmpeg`) or download from the [FFmpeg website](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) and add it to your system's PATH.
    *   **macOS:** Install using Homebrew (`brew install ffmpeg`).
    *   **Linux:** Install using your package manager (e.g., `sudo apt update && sudo apt install ffmpeg` on Debian/Ubuntu).

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OneTrickBreach/PrepIQ---AI-NLP-Interview-Assistant.git
cd PrepIQ---AI-NLP-Interview-Assistant
```

### 2. Python Backend Setup

- Navigate to the project root directory if you aren't already there.
- Create and activate a Python virtual environment (recommended):

  ```bash
  # Create the environment (only needs to be done once)
  python -m venv .venv 

  # Activate the environment (do this every time you work on the project)
  # Windows (PowerShell):
  .venv\Scripts\activate
  # macOS/Linux:
  # source .venv/bin/activate 
  ```

- Install Python dependencies:

  ```bash
  # Ensure your virtual environment is active first!
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
  *(Note: This will install PyTorch and Whisper. The first time Whisper runs, it may download the model weights, which can take some time and disk space.)*

### 3. Download the Trained Evaluation Model

The custom-trained evaluation model (`.pt` file) is required for the answer evaluation feature but is **not included** in this repository due to size limits.

- Download the latest trained model checkpoint from this link:
  **[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1puq4Luf4aBJQUyw6FHLV7jU5yAUOgzX_/view?usp=sharing]** *(Link provided by user)*

- After downloading, place the `.pt` file (e.g., `custom_evaluator_best.pt`) inside the `models/` directory in the project root. The backend will automatically load the latest model file from this directory when started.

### 4. Frontend Setup

- Navigate to the frontend directory:

  ```bash
  cd frontend
  ```

- Install Node.js dependencies:

  ```bash
  npm install
  ```

- Go back to the project root directory:

  ```bash
  cd .. 
  ```

### 5. Running the Application

You need to run the backend and frontend servers simultaneously in separate terminals.

- **Terminal 1: Run Backend Server**
  - Make sure you are in the project root directory (`PrepIQ---AI-NLP-Interview-Assistant`).
  - Activate your Python virtual environment (`.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1` or `source .venv/bin/activate`).
  - Start the FastAPI server:

    ```bash
    python -m src.main
    ```

- **Terminal 2: Run Frontend Server**
  - Open a new terminal.
  - Navigate to the `frontend` directory: `cd frontend`
  - Start the React development server:

    ```bash
    npm start dev
    ```

- Once both servers are running, the application should be available in your web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

---

## Generating Sample Data (Optional)

If you want to generate synthetic sample data for testing or retraining:

```bash
# Ensure your Python virtual environment is active
python scripts/generate_dataset.py
python scripts/organize_data.py
```

> **Note:** This synthetic data is very basic. For real training, replace or augment it with real, annotated examples.

---

## Training the Evaluation Model (Optional)

- To train from scratch:

```bash
# Ensure virtual environment is active
python scripts/train_custom_evaluator.py --data_dir organized_data/ --output_dir models/ --num_epochs 20 --batch_size 8
```

- To continue training from a checkpoint:

```bash
# Ensure virtual environment is active
python scripts/train_custom_evaluator.py --data_dir organized_data/ --output_dir models/ --num_epochs 10 --batch_size 8 --load_checkpoint "models/custom_evaluator_best.pt"
```

---

## Demo

A `demo.py` file is included to quickly start the backend and frontend and open the landing page. To use the demo, ensure that your Python virtual environment is active and that you have installed the Node.js dependencies for the frontend.

To run the demo, execute the following command:

```bash
python demo.py
```

**Important:** Make sure your environment is active before running the demo.

---

## Notes

- The `.gitignore` excludes large data/model directories and environment files.
- Placeholder files are included in excluded directories to preserve structure.
- You can customize roles, questions, and feedback templates by editing the data files or generation scripts.
- Speech-to-text is now handled locally using Whisper. Performance depends on your hardware and the chosen Whisper model size (default is "base").
